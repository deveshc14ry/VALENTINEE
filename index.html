                    I want you to know how much I love you, and How I care about you. Your messages, your presence even from far away and just having you in my life genuinely makes my days better and brighter in a very real way. 
                    You make me feel happier and more at ease, and that means more to me than you probably know.
                    <br><br>
                    I truly appreciate you for who you are and I’m so proud of you your strength, your efforts, and the way you carry yourself.
                    I adore you deeply. I really love your smile you look so adorable and cute when you smile, and I honestly can’t get enough of it. 
                    I just enjoy watching you, even during the quiet moments. Even when you’re asleep, 
                    there’s something about you that makes me want to stay and look a little longer. I am always there for you and I always love you.

                <div class="message-content">
                    Even though we haven’t met yet, you already mean so much to me. I won’t lie, i really hate the distance. 
                    It’s hard not being able to see you or be around you. But despite that, what we have feels real to me. 
                    My feelings haven’t changed because of the distance, they’ve only become clearer. I’m willing to take my time and keep choosing us, because you genuinely matter to me. 
                    And even though we don’t have a real photo together yet, I still feel like I’ve shared so many moments with you already. 
                    Those moments stay with me.

                <div class="message-content">
                    I don’t want to make big promises. I just want you to know that I truly care about you. 
                    I appreciate you a lot, I enjoy every conversation we share, and I’m really glad you’re in my life.
                    I think about how we were in the same city for years and still never met or knew each other, and 
                    that honestly makes me a little sad. It’s strange how close we were without realizing it.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, I’m grateful that we found each other now. Maybe the timing matters more than anything else.
                    What we have feels real to me, and being connected to you now means more to me than what could’ve happened back then.
                    This is how I feel, genuinely.
                    <br><br>
                    Happy Valentine’s Day Misssyy.
